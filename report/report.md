# Smart Public Transport Optimizer 🚍📍

## 1. Project Title
**AI-Powered Optimization of Public Transport Routes**  
*(Aligned with SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities)*

---

## 2. SDG Focus

- **Goal:** SDG 11 — Sustainable Cities and Communities  
- **Problem:** In many urban areas, inefficient bus routes lead to long commutes, fuel waste, and underutilized resources. There's a need to optimize public transport for better accessibility and reduced congestion.

---

## 3. AI Approach

- **Software Engineering Skills Applied:**
  - **Automation:** KMeans is used to automatically cluster bus stops by location.
  - **Testing:** Unit test validates cluster logic.
  - **Scalability:** Clean modular notebook, structured repo, ready to expand into route optimization.

- **Technical Solution:**  
  - Load real-world bus stop data
  - Use KMeans clustering to group stops
  - Visualize clusters on an interactive Folium map
  - Use outputs for potential route planning

---

## 4. Tools & Frameworks

- **AI/ML:** Scikit-learn (KMeans)
- **Software Engineering:** Git, Python, VS Code, Unit Testing
- **Data Source:** `sample_bus_stops.csv` (simulated dataset with lat/lon and stop names)
- **Visualization:** Folium (interactive map)

---

## 5. Deliverables

- ✅ `notebooks/01_clustering_and_routing.ipynb`
- ✅ `data/sample_bus_stops.csv`
- ✅ `tests/test_clustering.py`
- ✅ `output/clustered_map.html`
- ✅ `requirements.txt`
- ✅ `report/report.md` (this file)

---

## 6. Ethical & Sustainability Checks

- **Bias Mitigation:** Clustering is unsupervised and geography-based, but future versions should consider socioeconomic zones to avoid digital inequality.
- **Environmental Impact:** Promotes optimized routing, reducing emissions and idle time.
- **Scalability:** Can work with larger datasets and integrate real-time GPS feeds in future versions.

---

## 7. Reflection Questions

- **How does your solution align with SDG targets?**  
  It supports smart infrastructure, improves urban mobility, and reduces environmental impact — core elements of SDG 11.

- **Ethical risks & how they’re addressed?**  
  Future versions must avoid data bias when integrating socioeconomic data. Privacy will be key if integrating user feedback or real-time location.

- **How do software engineering practices help?**  
  Testing, modularity, and clean version control ensure the solution can scale sustainably.

---

## 8. Future Work

- Integrate with real-time GPS data
- Suggest optimal routes between clusters
- Use historical traffic data for dynamic routing
- Build a live dashboard or API endpoint
